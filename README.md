# Lab 8 - Starter
1. Within a Github action (1) because if we want and 'automated' test, it would make sense that we would make it so that the user does not have to do anything manually for the tests to run and also we should not run the tests after everything is done because we should be testing constantly as we are creating our product
2. No this is more for the big picture testing. Function returns would fall more under unit tests
3. No because this seems like it would involve multiple functions and inputs from the user. If we are trying to test from the user's perspective, it would make more sense that these would be E2E tests where we can see the inputs and outputs of the user.
4. Yes, this would make more sense to have a unit test for. Although we could test this with E2E, we can simply check using a boolean and attempt to pass in a string that is greater than 80 characters and see what the response of the function would be. This is simple enough that unit test would be able to check the functionality of it.
